# Hands-on_Lecture_2
The repository consists of 4 files. There are two different .java files, one for the Pascals Triangle code and the other for the spiral matrix code. The test_cases file has the different test cases I used to try out my code. For each test case, I also put what the expected output should be next to it. Finally, there is this README file. 
In the Pascals Triangle problem, we have to make a triangle with all 1s on the edges of the triangle. In the inner section of the triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above. 
The spiral matrix problem asks us to read a user-inputted matrix in a spiral order.
